[Hackerrank's infamous 30 days of code solution.](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)

## Recommended Python Resources

- [Learning Python - Tutorials Point Resource](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)
- [More on Python - W3 School Resource](https://www.w3schools.com/PYTHON/)
- [Python for Everybody Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

**Note**: One of the above resources if done perfectly are enough but personally I would recommend
to combine the `Python for Everybody Specialization - Coursera` along with one the resorces from
either `Tutorials Point` or `W3 School` specially for data sciences.
